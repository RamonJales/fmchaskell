# fmchaskell

This repository contains exercises done in the Haskell functional programming language.

We start by defining, in the "nat.hs" file, the Nat data type. We then define some functions used for this type of data, such as: addition, multiplication, exponentiation, among others. All of them recursively. The possible forms of a Nat are the O or a success of some Nat(S). The beauty of this is that we have just built the natural numbers to infinity.
